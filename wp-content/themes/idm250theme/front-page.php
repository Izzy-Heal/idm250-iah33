<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Izzy. I am a UXID major at Drexel University. I am passionate about creating 
    beautiful exciting things. Along with my UX and Ui design that my school work is centered around I spend a lot of time developing my artistic 
skills and vision. </p>
<p>I get inspiration from a huge number of sources. Some of the most prominent being the aesthetics of horror espesially as 
it relates to queer aesthetics. I also love many different movements in art history with my favorite being Dada. I am also inspired 
by many individual artists and musicians, including David Bowie, Sergio Toppi, Orville Peck, Gustav Klimt, and Jean-Michel Basquiat.</p>
<p>I hope that my work is able to bring you joy in some capacity if you are feeling so inclined check out my social media:</p>
